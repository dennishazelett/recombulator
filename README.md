# README

Recombulator is a suite of python functions that serve to calculate
the recombination frequency between any two loci on any chromosome of
the fly genome, given as a gene name or a genomic coordinate. The code
has been tested on a python interpreter shell on a Debian Linux with
AMD64/x86-64 in 32 bits and later in 64 bits on a dual core processor.

This directory contains two files that are necessary to run
recombulator.

recombTools.py
geneheader.txt

## REQUIREMENTS

Tkinter, python-psyco (recommended)

## RUNNING RECOMBULATOR

To run recombulator in user-friendly mode, simply execute
recombTools.py in python from the command line, and the GUI will
appear.

## NOTES 

If you have the python-psyco module installed you can uncomment the
lines pertaining to psyco at the beginning of the program.
